description: Buddhism is a religion which must be viewed from many angles. Its original
  form, as preached by Gautama in India and developed in the early years succeeding,
  and as embodied in the sacred literature of early Buddhism, is not representative
  of the actual Buddhism of any land today. The faithful student of Buddhist literature
  would be as far removed from understanding the working activities of a busy center
  of Buddhism in Burmah, Tibet or China today as a student of patristic literature
  would be from appreciating the Christian life of London or New York City. Moreover
  Buddhism, like Christianity.
